# MNIST_E2E
A end to end application based on the MNIST Dataset

## Task Overview
* [ ] __Create a standin application__
  * [ ] Lets go simple for now, and then upgrade it to a react app later
  * [ ] Possible tech stack, react? 
  * [ ] How to draw
  * [ ] How to access the camera
  * [ ] Manipulate image to format to fit into the model
  * [ ] Load the model
  * [ ] Dynamic Update the model?

* [ ] __Figure out how to create the MNIST model in tensorflow.js__
  * [ ] Read the docs
  * [X] Look at sample code pieces  
  * [x] Create and train the model? -> Done in python tensorflow.keras
  * [x] Save/Pickle the model
  * [ ] Use saved pickled model through js
  * [x] No need to create model in tf.js, create in python, save it and load it to use in the web-app

* [ ] __Figure out how to deploy the model on the client side device__
  * [ ] No clue, tensorflow.js or tensorflow lite, actually possible to run on the browser/app entirely, and not on node?

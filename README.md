* [ ] __Figure out how to create the MNIST model in tensorflow.js__
  * [ ] Read the docs
  * [ ] Look at sample code pieces  
  * [ ] Create and train the model?
  * [ ] Save/Pickle the model
  * [ ] Use saved pickled model through js
  * [ ] No need to create model in tf.js, create in python, save it and load it to use in the web-app
